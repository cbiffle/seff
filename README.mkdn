# SEFF - Simple Embeddable Font Format

This crate is designed to allow decent text rendering in resource-constrained
environments like microcontrollers.

Feature summary:

- Compiles to less than 1.5 kiB of code on `thumbv7em`.
- Proportional (variable-width) fonts in addition to monospaced (terminal)
  fonts.
- Fonts can include kerning information.
- Aggressively optimized font data structures are cheap to store and relatively
  cheap to render. (Monospace fonts of about 8 pixels and larger are typically
  60% smaller represented in SEFF than in their naive array-of-bits form.)
- Build-time code generation takes fonts in an easily editable PNG format and
  produces Rust code, if you don't want to paste the code in directly.
- When built in render-only mode, has no dependencies. In particular, does not
  depend on any particular embedded HAL.

Drawbacks/limitations:

- The Unicode support is very weak; the library currently works best for 8-bit
  text encodings.
- Does not support fonts containing more than 256 glyphs. (I plan to have a
  fallback mechanism for combining fonts if you need this.)
- Does not support RTL or vertical text directions. (Mostly due to my own lack
  of understanding of the subtleties.)
- Does not support text scaling or vector fonts. Each font has a fixed size,
  chosen at build time. (This one's deliberate; we can store font data more
  compactly if we know the required size up-front.)
- Does not support antialiasing. (Pixels are getting very small these days.)

## The PNG font format

See the `fonts` directories for examples of the PNG input format.
